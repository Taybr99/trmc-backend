CallFire Node.JS SDK
====================

This is an unofficial, unsupported SDK for the CallFire API. While it is
maintained in parallel to the PHP SDK, it is not yet stable. When using this
in production applications, please lock yourself to a specific patch version,
as breaking changes may occur in such version as improvements are made.
