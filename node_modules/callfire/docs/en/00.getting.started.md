Getting Started
===============

The CallFire API provides a robust interface to control functionality available through the regular web interface,
plus some controls which are not otherwise accessible.

This library provides a set of node.js classes to interface with the
[CallFire API](http://www.callfire.com/api-documentation). Please refer to the
[API documentation](http://www.callfire.com/api-documentation) for information
on finding your API credentials.

## The REST API

The REST API will be the primary API endpoint in our example documentation, because its design
aims to make the structure of API requests more intuitive and stable.

### Very basic example
This example demonstrates how to instantiate the REST API client, create
a request object, invoke a request, and then parse the response into
an easily-consumable form.  
```node
var callfire = require('callfire');

(function() {
    'use strict';
    
    var broadcast = new callfire("<api-username>", "<api-password>", "Broadcast");
    
    broadcast.QueryBroadcasts({
        MaxResults: 10
    }, function(response) {
        var result = broadcast.response(response),
            i = 0;
        
        console.log('There are ' + result.totalResults + ' total broadcasts.');
        console.log('Here are the ones returned:');
        
        for(i = 0; i < result.resources.length; i++) {
            console.log(result.resources[i]);
        }
    });
}) ();
```

### Responses

All client methods for doing API calls accept a callback function which is passed
the raw response body from the API upon success.

Each client has a `::response` method which can be used to parse the raw response
data into one of the `Response` types (e.g. ResourceList).
